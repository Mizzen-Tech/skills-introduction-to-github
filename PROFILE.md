Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am using GitHub Classroom to teach version control and collaborative project management to my 9th grade technology class.

I am excited for them to be able to use these tools for their Game Jam project at the end of the semester.

The Push and Pull processes should really help them focus their workflow for the game and foster creative design.

This is how we make a change.
